/*
Develop a menu-driven Animal Simulator in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
concepts, allowing users to interact with various animals through a simple text interface. Each
animal should exhibit core behaviors like eating, sleeping, and making a unique sound. The
program must apply principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and
polymorphism, using an abstract base class and derived subclasses.


Note:
- Program must be written in C++
- The user is presented with a menu listing various animals (Dog, Cat, Horse, Bird, Fish, and Hamster)
- Upon selecting an animal, the user sees a submenu with the following actions:
    - Eat
    - Sleep
    - Make Sound (specific to the animal)
    - Display Information
- The user can repeat interactions with different animals.
- The program should exit cleanly upon request.
